This is a total remake of the program I wrote in 2023, Bibliofile. Bibliofile was a complete TUI program that allowed people to read ebooks from a terminal user interface(TUI). However it was hosted on my private git server which has now been removed. I had downloaded a backup of the program and was going to reupload it here, but as of May 2025 it is not in the place I had saved it to.

Seeing as I cannot find my backup anywhere, I feel that I must remake it from scratch. This is frustrating, but I already know how the program works so it will not take nearly as long to rewrite it as it did to figure it out the first time around.

This readme will be changed in the future once I have gotten to the place where I was last time, but for now i wanted to give an update for any friends that I have not seen in a while that may be checking up on me, and are wondering where Bibliofile went. It was my own stupid self that lost the files, though I don't know how they disappeared. 

I am restructuring the project, as I made many mistakes last time and I have a better idea on how to start the project out to make it easier on myself later on.
